# vimrc

Install:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/oxo42/vimrc.git ~/.vim
cd ~/.vim
git submodule update --recursive --init
```

Note: on Windows & Mac I had to make a `~/_vimrc` or `~/.vimrc` that contains

```vim
source ~/.vim/vimrc
```

I am bringing this in as it's own repository as a part of my [dot files](https://github.com/oxo42/drox)
